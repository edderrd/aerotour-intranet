#- What is class-db:
Class-db is a php5 base class to create database access wrapper
and to ease programmer work when it's time to work with database.
Class-db comes with some extended class for mysql and sqlite so
you can check thoose out to see how to create your own extended
database wrapper.

#- History
I've created first version of class-db in 2003 (in fact it was only
class-mysqldb at this time) to assist me dealing with mysql database
common operation. after some change and i finally split it in a two
class: class-db and class-mysqldb in 2006 (there was already a sqlite
wrapper too at this time)
Over the time i added it some stuff as some methods to paginate results
and one of my favourite the smart question marks in conditions strings.
(still in 2006). I also added the possibility to have a single
instance of the same database connection (since 2007) and a new
decorator dbProfiler class to help profiling your application in 2008
and there we are.
